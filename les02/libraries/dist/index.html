<h2>
    Bundling JavaScript Code
</h2>

<h3>Used Tools</h3>
<p>
    We use <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">NPM</a>
    to download the library
    <a href="https://lodash.com/">loadash</a>.
    This is a very popular library providing several utility functions.
    Here, we just use some of them related to arrays.
    When NPM is run on a project, it will read the content of the
    'package.json' configuration file.
</p>

<p>
    Because 'loadash' is a library, it needs to be imported in this HTML file besides
    our own JavaScript code.
    We use <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">Webpack</a> to bundle all the JS code
    together into a single 'bundle.js' file.
    This also improves performance, as the browser needs to do only a single HTTP GET
    call to get all the needed JS.
</p>

<p>
    Note that, to properly use 'Webpack', we need to do some manual changes into the
    'package.json' configuration file of NPM.
    You could expect some comments directly in the 'package.json' to describe what needs
    to be changed.
    Unfortunately, this is not possible, because the JSON format does not support comments!!!
    You might wonder why JSON was chosen as configuration format instead of more sane
    options like YAML or XML (in this context XML is better than JSON)...
    Yes, that is a big limitation of NPM (and its developers have no intention to fix it).
    Note: there are some
    <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14221579/how-do-i-add-comments-to-package-json-for-npm-install">
        workarounds
    </a>
    to somehow simulate comments in JSON, but those are really awful, dirty hacks.
</p>


<h3>Example With Loadash</h3>

<p>
    Array value: <span id="arrayStringId"></span>
</p>
<ui>
    <li>_.min(): <span id="minId"></span></li>
    <li>_.max(): <span id="maxId"></span></li>
    <li>_.mean(): <span id="meanId"></span></li>
    <li>_.sum(): <span id="sumId"></span></li>
</ui>


<h3>Executed Commands</h3>

<ui>
    <li>
        npm init -y
        <br/>
        To create a default 'package.json' file
    </li>
    <li>
        npm install --save lodash
        <br/>
        To install 'loadash' library
    </li>
    <li>
        npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli
        <br/>
        To install WebPack, but as a developer tool, and not as part of production deployment.
    </li>
</ui>
