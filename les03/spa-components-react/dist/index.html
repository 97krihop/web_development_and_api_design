<h2>Important To Know</h2>

<p>
    To use React we need to import it as a library.
    However, we no longer write JS, but rather JSX.
    JSX is a format in which HTML and JS can be easily mixed together.
    That is the reason why all the files now ends in <em>.jsx</em>
    instead of <em>.js</em>.
</p>

<p>
    The browser has no clue of JSX, and all these files need to be transformed
    into JS before they can be used in a browser.
    To do that, we need to instruct WebPack to use Babel with React preset when
    building the <em>bundle.js</em> file.
    Look at the configuration files <em>.babelrc</em> and <em>webpack.config.js</em>.
    Meditate on the lack of comments there, and how it could have been helpful
    to have them directly there where the different configuration settings are added.
    Sorry, not going to write abominations like <em>"//": "..."</em>.
